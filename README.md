# Core Java & DSA Preparation 🚀

This repository contains my daily practice for Core Java and
Data Structures & Algorithms, focused on SDE interviews.

## Folder Structure

- Core-java → Java basics, OOPs, arrays, strings
- DSA → Sorting, searching, recursion, trees
- Notes → Interview revision (to be added)

## Language

- Java

## Goal

Build strong fundamentals with clean, well-structured code and
consistent GitHub activity.
